# FiOne

Pronounced like "Fiona" with an "e". This software aims to provide a decently fast and reliable way of executing Lua 5.1 bytecode under other Lua environments without the use of `load` or `loadstring`. For the purpose of anything from sandboxing to reimplementing arbitrary execution, this should serve your needs.

Note that only an interpreter is provided, and compiled code must be obtained from some external source.
