this fork of ScriptableComputer
fork creation was approved by the authors of the mod
for the mod to work correctly, there SHOULD BE NO "ScriptableComputer" and/or "SCI" in the world
this mod DOES NOT VIOLATE anyone's licenses, the author of the original does not mind that I am doing a fork
this mod DOES NOT CONTAIN SCI and ScrapComputers code and partial compatibility is implemented using a layer

advantages of SComputers compared to any other computer mods:

  [*] the presence of require and built-in libraries (image, midi, vdisplay, base64, utf8, ramfs, etc)

  [*] availability of new components
  [*] regular updates (about every month)
  [*] support for crafting recipes
